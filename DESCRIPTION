This directory holds Xinu sources for the Galileo. This version is specifically
for students in CSCI 8530 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. It is the
initial version for the Fall 2017 semester.

It is a modification of the Purdue Xinu distribution for the Galileo.
Specifically, it deals with the possibility that (a) there is no Ethernet link,
or (b) there is Ethernet but no DHCP server, or (c) the user uses the
netstatus command to shut down the networking.

It also has vacuous versions of the swait and ssignal system functions (in the
expected files), and an implemention of a solution to the Dining Philosopers 
problem using swait and ssignal. Of course it won't work correctly until those
system calls are written. Implementation of those system calls may, or may not,
be assigned during the Fall 2017 semester.

The mklfs command is provided to build a local filesystem on the RAM disk.
A few additional commands are provided to manipulate files, along with a
few extensions to the LFS devices.

Multiple timeserver IP addresses are defined in net/dhcp.c. These are used in
getutime, in the order given, as needed in case of timeouts. The IP addresses
can obviously be changed as desired.

This version has the UECHO device (which should eventually be renamed).

A simple BASIC interpreter "basic" is provided.

A simple line-oriented text editor calle "e0" is provided.

A TFTP ("Trivial File Transfer Protocol") client "tftp" is provided.

The "reboot" command is provided, and works with Galileo Gen 1 and Gen 2.
